# Mounting Bracket ID

The VentMon T0.4 case is just a little too large to mount behind the Element 14
Raspberry PI 7" TFT screen. However, that screen, and many others, has a
VESA-D 75mm mount on the back. I propose that we make a flat bracket that
mounts to this with the standard M4 screws, with a projection large enough
for us to zip-tie a VentMon T0.4 to it.

We may change the case for the T0.5; but in any case this system allows
the VentMon device to be easily separated from the Touch screen.

Our goal is to produce a maximally modular system; if you can use
a VentMon without the larger screen if you want.  If we were selling
devices (which we are not), the two components would be "sold separately".
Instead, they are "designed separately", and a manufacturer may make
and sell one or both.

The motivation of this is in particular to go to a hospital in LMIC
that might have broken ventilators and to be able to quickly assess,
test, and repair the ventilators (with the help of a plastic test lung,
not produced by us.)

Note: The mockup below is a WIP -- there may be better approaches. I'm publishing it here for comment.

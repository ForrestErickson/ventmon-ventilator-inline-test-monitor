\textbf{Abstract:}

Humanitarian engineers responded to the pandemic ventilator shortage of March,
2020, by beginning over 100 open source ventilator projects.
Inexpensive ventilator test equipment facilitates projects forced
to be geographically distributed by lockdowns.
The VentMon is a modular, open source, IoT-enabled
tester that plugs into a standard 22mm airway
between a ventilator and a physical test lung to test any ventilator
by graphing flow, pressure, oxygen fraction, humidity and temperature
at a data lake accessible to all team members. This is the data
needed by a test team, but also the data desired by a clinician in
actual treatment of patients. The open source design of the VentMon
and its firmware and cloud-based software may
allow it to be used as a component of modular ventilators to provide
a clinical readout. This software system has been designed to be as
modular and composeable as possible, for example by defining
new open published standards, just as the hardware is composeable
and modifiable, forming an open system or eco-system of ventilation data.
Thanks to grants, 20 VentMons have been given away
free of charge to pandemic response teams building open source ventilators,
some of which have been used successfully.

\section{Hardware in context}
% Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.
The Coronavirus pandemic has created a global shortage of ventilators.Ventilators are expensive to manufacture and during uncertain times supply chains can be disrupted increasing the cost and scarcity of these devices. Since the beginning of the pandemic in March, there has been a large movement to develop cheaper, more supply chain resilient ventilator. The urgency and goals of this movement have shifted as the global understanding of the virus has evolved. Regardless of the current state of this movement, however, the use of open source medical devices in resources limited emergency situations -- common during a global pandemic -- is a topic that has come to the forefront of may conversations about preparedness and treatment. Medical devices require rigorous testing before they can be used on the general public. Open source medical devices require the same level, if not more scrutiny. If an open source movement is to succeed in this field, the tools to test and validate medical devices should also be community based. The goal of VentMon is to provide an equally open source, community based verification solution to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the development process for socially distanced, potentially international teams making open source ventilator devices.

\section{Hardware description}
% Describe the hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps of the procedure. Highlight how it differs/which advantage it offers over pre-existing methods. For example, how could this hardware: be compared to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, be used in the development of further designs in a particular area, and so on.

% > Add 3-5 bulleted points to broadly explain to other researchers how the hardware could be potentially useful to them, for either standard or novel laboratory tasks, inside or outside of the original user community.

The VentMon plugs directly into a standard 22mm adult airway. As air or medicaly gases pass through the VentMon, it records flow and pressure about 40 times a second, and occasionally records temperature, humdity, and O2 fraction. The result is that when placed in the airway between an invasive or non-invasive ventilator under test and physcial test lung, it sends this data to a public data lake using a clearly defined respiration standard. This data can be graphically rendered either live or statically to provide a display that is typical of the clinical display of advance ventilators. In this way it allows sophisticated testing of ventilators. This device is therefore similar in function to an ASL5000 or a Michigan Test Lung device, which tend to start at USD\$10,000.

A special challenge of teams building open source pandemic ventilators is that they tend to be poorly funded,
but also geographically distributed. The VentMon is an IoT-enbabled device which sends its data to a public data lake,
where a team member on a different continent can view it live in real time as a collleagure makes adjustments
to the ventilator.

The VentMon thus offer benefits to teams developing ventilation devices:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is inexpensive.
\item It is completely open and part of a modular hardware/software system that can be customized and extended.
\item It is allows remote collaboration.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, being completely open, it supports modifcation, extension, and importantly but only potentially at present, integration into a complete ventilator. A ventilator that chose to offer a graphical trace of pressure and flow, which are generally demanded by clinicians for all but emergency transport situations, could incorporate the open source VentMon into its complete design.

Although the reliance on the internet is a strength for a distributed engineering team, it would be a disadvantage it a field hospital. Although aiming to eventually be safe enough and reliable to be used as a monitor on human patients, it requires much improvement before it is ready for that intended use.

Two versions of VentMon can be assembled depending on availability of parts and time. The most physically robust and complete version of VentMon requires the purchase and manufacture of a PCB as well as a number of 3D printed plastic parts. The designs of the PCB and 3D printed parts are fully open; in practice, due to the fact that PCBs have a high set up cost, it makes most sense to use the PCB if you are bulding 10 or more VentMons. This version of the device requires the least amount of time to assemble and contains fewest discrete components. Due to the high cost of PCB manufacture and assembly, VentMon can also be created using off the shelf components readily available from DIY electronics suppliers. This version requires significantly more assembly time. We believe this has been done twice by third parties with little interaction with us. Both assembly procedures are outlined below.

Because the VentMon produces pressure and flow graphs at about 25 samples per seconds which is fast compared to
the physiological process of breathing, it is easy to have confidence in the basic dynamic function of the VentMon
by simply breathing through it into a plastic test lung. One can easily see that flow and pressure dynamically
match the breath or changes in the mechanical ventilation, or even changes induces by changes in the resistance of
compliance of the test lung.

The flow and pressure sensors used in the VentMon require not calibration. Flow was checked with a graduated syringe and
found to be quite accurate. Pressure sensors can be double checked by checking ambient pressure and, for example, computing
altitude of the physcial location.

Other aspects of ventilation such as respiration rate, peak inspiratory pressure, Inhalation to Exhalation ratio,
work of breathing, etc. are dependenent on the VentDisplay software which are a module not technically part of the VentMon
hardware. This software has been shown to be valuable, although it is dependent on accurate software decisions about
the beginning and the ending of a breath, which can be subtle in some situations.
